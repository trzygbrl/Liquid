# Build Log — Civic Access (Team Liquid)

This file tracks what's actually been built, in plain language, so any teammate can scroll through and understand progress without needing to read code or git commit history. Newest entries go on top.

**This is different from the PRD's Change Log:** the PRD Change Log tracks *decisions* (what we decided to change and why). This file tracks *what was actually built* as a result.

## How entries get added

Every build prompt given to a coding agent should end with an instruction like:

> "After completing this, append an entry to `/docs/BUILD_LOG.md` following the format below — what was built, which files were touched, and any decisions or trade-offs made."

The agent adds the entry itself, at the top of the "Entries" section below, following this format:

```
### [Date] — [Short title of what was built]
**Task:** [roadmap task number, e.g. 3.2]
**Owner:** [role or name]
**What changed:** [1-3 sentences, plain language, no jargon — written for someone who didn't watch it get built]
**Files touched:** [list of files/folders]
**Notes/trade-offs:** [anything worth flagging — a shortcut taken, something left for later, a decision made on the fly]
```

If you're building manually (not through an agent), add the same entry yourself when you finish a task.

## Entries

### 2026-08-14 — Supabase schema, RLS, and client setup
**Task:** 1.2
**Owner:** Coding agent
**What changed:** Created all six database tables from PRD Section 6 (`specialty_taxonomy`, `patients`, `doctors`, `schedule_slots`, `appointments`, `reviews`) with correct column types, foreign keys, check constraints, and indexes. Enabled Row-Level Security on every table and added a starter policy set. Created the Supabase JS client helper at `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` (the correct location for the `@/*` alias). Deleted the empty root-level `lib/supabaseClient.ts` placeholder that was there before.
**Files touched:**
- `supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` [NEW] — full schema + RLS SQL; paste into Supabase SQL Editor or apply via `supabase db push`
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` [NEW] — Supabase anon-key client, importable as `@/lib/supabaseClient`
- `lib/supabaseClient.ts` + `lib/` directory [DELETED] — replaced by `src/lib/`
**Notes/trade-offs:**
- **`patients`/`doctors` → `auth.users` FK design**: Both tables use `auth.users(id)` as their own primary key (no separate `auth_user_id` column). Role is determined by which table a row exists in. If Task 1.3 creates bare `doctors` rows at signup, `name`/`specialty`/`rate` constraints will need to relax to nullable — that's a PRD Change Log entry.
- **Composite FK `doctors(specialty, sub_specialty)` → `specialty_taxonomy`**: Enforces the taxonomy constraint at the DB level (PRD Section 8.1 assumed it; this makes it explicit). Doctors can't be created with a specialty/sub_specialty pair that isn't in the seeded taxonomy table.
- **`lib/` → `src/lib/` relocation**: `tsconfig.json` maps `@/*` to `./src/*` only. Anything importing `@/lib/supabaseClient` would have silently failed at runtime with the old root-level `lib/`. File is now at `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
- **`appointments_update_involved` RLS policy is intentionally broad** — tighten it in Task 4.2/2.3 once the exact per-role update shapes are known.
- **Review "completed appointment" gate is app-level only** — check `appointment.status === 'completed'` before showing the review form. A DB trigger can enforce this server-side if needed (Task 5.1).
- **No `@supabase/ssr` yet** — the current client is the anon-key browser client. Cookie-based session handling for Server Components / Route Handlers is a Task 1.3 decision.

### [Fill in Day 1] — Repo, PRD, and roadmap committed
**Task:** 1.0
**Owner:** A
**What changed:** Created the GitHub repo, added the PRD, roadmap, and this build log to `/docs`.
**Files touched:** `/docs/liquid-prd.md`, `/docs/liquid-roadmap.md`, `/docs/BUILD_LOG.md`
**Notes/trade-offs:** None.
